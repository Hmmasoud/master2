## HowToUse

To get started, open `script.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

This is a project in which you will be able to create a pixel in a canvas and color it.  The script.js is providing the proper code required.  

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for me as a Udacity student. Therefore, I hope you find it well-accepted.
